# Learner-Attention-Detection-and-Dynamic-Tutorial-Recommendation-using-Image-processing-Techniques
The project predicts a student's engagement in a classroom/e-learning platform by evaluating and monitoring their facial emotions, eye gaze, and head movements. Based on these results, a list of recommended tutorials is provided.

• OpenCV is used to monitor students' behaviour, and feature extraction algorithms are applied.

• A pre-trained Emotion Model is used to recognize facial emotions through Principal Component Analysis. Keras is used to load this model. 

• Haar Cascade and Local Binary Patterns are used for pupil detection and head movements, respectively.
